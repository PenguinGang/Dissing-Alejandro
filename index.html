        <h2>#1 Betrayal of his 'best friend'.</h2>
        <p>Here the story goes:</p>
        <p>Preston, Carter, and Alejandro were friends in school.</p>
        <p>Carter had a crush on a girl named Jennifer ever since fifth grade, and Carter is now in seventh grade.</p>
        <p>Alejandro and Preston promised to support Carter get together with his crush for the first semester.</p>
        <p>But during the second semester after winter break, Preston stayed loyal to Carter.</p>
        <p>Alejandro on the other hand, he started to change in a bad way.</p>
        <p>Alejandro started to hangout with Jennifer and started flirting with her.</p>
        <p>For the first part, it was not very noticable to anyone, but Preston slowly found out what Alejandro was doing.</p>
        <p>Carter on the other hand, was completely oblivious to Alejandro's actions.</p>
        <p>Alejandro was "helping" Carter by slowly betraying him.</p>
        <p>Preston eventually confronted Alejandro about it, but he denied the acusation.</p>
        <p>As the betrayal went on, Carter kept on dismissing the betrayal, and eventually Preston started to give up too.</p>
        <p>Preston does not handle betrayal, but he has no other choice but to let go.</p>
